  % Technical requirements should be more about the requirements that would make this project a success
  This command line utility requires the Haskell Platform and LaTeX. The Haskell Platform includes GHC (a Haskell compiler) and Cabal, which is Haskell's primary package manager. LaTeX is needed to build LaTeX posts into their resulting PDFs. After the Haskell Platform has been installed, installing BlaTeX is simple:

  \begin{lstlisting}
  > cabal install blatex
  \end{lstlisting}
