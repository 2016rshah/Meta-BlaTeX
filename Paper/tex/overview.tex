  % Briefly outline the method used to develop the project
  The project is a command line utility that is written in Haskell. Haskell is a statically-typed functional programming language that makes heavy use of the REPL. Libraries were tested/experimented with independently in their own files. After the necessary functions were written, they were integrated into the final product. The finished project was assembled into an executable file and deployed to Haskell's package manager (Hackage).
