  % How did you test and validate your code?
  Because this tool was written in Haskell (a statically-typed, compiled programming language), most insidious bugs were filtered out at compile time. Haskell development is also strongly integrated with using a Haskell REPL (read-eval-print-loop). Thus, each function was experimented with in the REPL after being written and before being pushed to production.
