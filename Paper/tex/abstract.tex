BlaTeX is a static-site compiler for LaTeX posts written in Haskell. It is a Haskell program that a user can invoke through a command-line interface; it consumes a directory full of LaTeX source code files and their output and generates a static HTML/PDF website for those posts. The project is mainly focused on users who would like to maintain a blog about their academic/professional/personal work in computer science or mathematics.
