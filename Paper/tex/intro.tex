Markdown and HTML are the standard tools used to write standard tech blogs with. But they have weak support for embedding mathematical formulas, and are not conducive to writing for an extended period of time. So instead of writing posts in Markdown, my project allows writers to create posts in LaTeX (a powerful type-setting and markup language) and generate a static-site that can be deployed to any hosting service.
